                <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    IRJEP aims to contribute to the responsible study of ethnomedicine by encouraging research that is
                    scientifically grounded, ethically conducted, and culturally informed. As ethnomedicine continues to
                    inform research, practice, and policy, IRJEP offers a structured forum for scholarly analysis and documentation.
